As you may noticed already, correspondence chess is available now on pychess site. First I thought it will be casual only, but after [@CouchTomato87]() and [@SteveatKurihara] noticed rated correspondence games are available on lishogi and on all correspondence chess sites. So I changed my mind and implemented rated play also. I know lichess doesn't allow it, because there was lots of complaint about how it has effects on the leaderboards. We will see. The ratings are not separated from real time variant ratings, similar to lishogi.

The rules are the same as on lichess/lishogi. Using everything is alloved except the engines!

Implementing thie feature affected almost all of the code base, so possibe it will bring new bugs and some regressions, so feel free to report bugs on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/issues) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/aPs8RKr)
